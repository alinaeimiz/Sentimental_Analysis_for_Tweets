# **Sentiment Analysis Project**  

This project performs sentiment analysis using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to classify text data based on the sentiment it expresses (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). The analysis is performed using three different approaches: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Deep Learning model. This comparative approach highlights the strengths and limitations of each method in sentiment prediction tasks.

## **Overview**  

Sentiment analysis is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications ranging from social media monitoring to customer feedback analysis. This project aims to process text data and build predictive models to classify the sentiment expressed in tweets.  

The analysis is divided into three parts:  
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline machine learning model to classify sentiments.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A robust and widely used model for text classification tasks.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: An advanced approach using neural networks for sentiment classification.  

## **Features**  

- Preprocesses raw text data for sentiment classification  
- Visualizes sentiment distribution in the dataset  
- Implements Logistic Regression, SVM, and Deep Learning models  
- Compares model performances using metrics like accuracy and F1-score  

## **Dataset**  

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Sentimental Analysis for Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gargmanas/sentimental-analysis-for-tweets/code)  

The dataset contains labeled tweets with sentiments such as positive, negative, and neutral, providing a foundation for building predictive models.  

## **Installation**  

1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alinaeimiz/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```  

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:  

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_tweets.ipynb
   ```  

## **Usage**  

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.  
2. Run the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess data, visualize it, and train models.  
3. Explore the comparative performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Deep Learning models.  

## **Results**  

The sentiment analysis models achieved the following performance:  

- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy = 98% 
- **SVM**: Accuracy = XX%, F1-score = 99%  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Accuracy = 98%

Visualizations include word clouds, sentiment distribution, and model performance metrics.
